The purpose of Assignment 1 was to implement a singly-linked list in Java using eclipes. We were then expected to create four methods. 
The methods were:

boolean add (int e); - Add the int if it is not already in the linked list.
boolean remove (int e); - Remove the int if it is in the linked list.
int size(); - Return the size if the specified linked list. 
boolean equals(Object obj); - Compare two linked lists to see if the are the same. 

Effectiveness: 

Test case with ADD  

Result - Added the given ints. 

Pro: Added the int if they were not in the linked list.
Con: May run into errors if it tries to compare the wrong variable type.

----------------------------------------------------------

Test cases with REMOVE

Pro: Removes the int if it is in the linked list.
Con: It will only remove the first occurence. If there are any others, it won't remove them.

----------------------------------------------------------

Test case with SIZE

Pro: Very simple.
Con: No noteble cons can be thought of. 

----------------------------------------------------------

Test cases with EQUAL.

Result - Gave the expected results with the 2 linked lists used. 

Pro: it gave the expected result using these 2 linked lists.
Con: Most likely would run into an error if we tried a Linked list of chars.
